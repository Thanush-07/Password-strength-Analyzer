# 🔐 Password Strength Checker - Python Tkinter Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **desktop GUI application** built using **Python** and **Tkinter**. It allows users to check the strength of a password by analyzing its characters and length. As the user types a password, the app instantly gives feedback on whether the password is **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**.

This project is great for learning about **GUI design**, **password security**, and **regex validation** in Python.
